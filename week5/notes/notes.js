    NPM = node package manager
    npm -g list = list of (something??)
    npm i -g - installs the package (i for install) globally (-g)

Inside the directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

Begin by typing:

  cd /Users/robyn/Documents/codeclasswork/lecture-notes/week5/react-lesson
  
  *npm start*

  package.json is for us to use
  package-lock.json is what the program needs to work

  Use readme to explain how it works and how it's built

    * robots.txt controls whether search engines can index or not
   
  src contains
    * setupTests.js - use for testing out logic issues
    * index.js - this holds the info that goes to the root in index.html for rendering on the page
    * app.js - the main component of the react application (most of work is done here)
